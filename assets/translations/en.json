        "description": "As a rule, the e-vignette is tied to the vehicle and in particular to the license plate and is not transferable. This means that the e-vignette is valid for the registered vehicle and for the period specified in the purchase and cannot be transferred to another person, as the vehicle's license plate is immutable and the authorization to use it is linked to this license plate.\n"

      "question19": {
        "description": "The possibility of a refund for an e-vignette depends on the specific policies of the country or provider from which the vignette was purchased. Many toll systems do not allow refunds after purchasing an e-vignette, as it is considered a type of tax for the use of the infrastructure and the service is considered \"delivered\" once the vignette is valid."

          "title": "Route toll: ",
          "description": "This is charged for the use of certain road sections, such as large bridges, tunnels or mountain passes. The fee is only due for actually passing these special routes and is independent of the duration of the road use. In Austria, a route toll is charged for some special routes such as the Brenner motorway, the Tauern motorway or the Arlberg tunnel."

        "description": "Normally, after paying and purchasing a digital vignette, you can drive on the roads in the relevant country that require a vignette. The digital vignette is usually activated immediately after purchase, unless a later start of the validity period has been specified. However, it is important to ensure that you have received confirmation of the purchase of the vignette and that the vignette has been correctly registered for your vehicle according to the registration number provided. Please keep the purchase confirmation safe so that you can provide proof of purchase if necessary."
